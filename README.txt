Use 'UT_Fourier.m' and 'UT_VelocityAnalysis.m' and follow the command line. Have Fun!

Keep a copy of the directory to prevent the loss of data due to changes that are made by the user.

Changes can have effects downstream to functions and folders. Changes to 'UT_SaveSignalsSequence.m' may be an exception to that rule.

'UT_Fourier.m' and 'UT_VelocityAnalysis.m' work fine in their original state. Ultrasonic signal analysis can be performed through these functions in Matlab.

All files within the 'UT Signal Analysis' are sensitive to small changes.

All files functional in original state as of July 6, 2018, using MATLAB R2018a with Signal Processing Toolbox.
