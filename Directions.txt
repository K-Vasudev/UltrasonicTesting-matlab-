1. How to Perform Velocity Measurement

-Open 'UT_VelocityAnalysis.m' in Matlab.
-Press 'Run' in the 'Editor' tab of the Matlab console
-Follow instructions in the Command Window of Matlab
-Plot will open in a new tab
-Press 'Hide Peaks' to toggle red circles around signal peaks
-Zoom to desired signal section and press 'Print Peaks' to see the time and voltage for each peak with a red circle visible around it
*adjustments can be made to script, but only to designated parameters


2. How to View Fourier Transforms

-Open 'UT_Fourier.m' in Matlab
-Press 'Run' in the 'Editor' tab of the Matlab console
-Follow instructions in the Command Window of Matlab
-Plot will open in a new tab
-Use the full signal to gauge the desired location to Fourier transform and enter the window center and window width when prompted
-Use Freq_Vector and Power_Spectrum variables to save signal


3. How to Save a New Ultrasonic Data Set - Preferred Method
	This method uses 'UT_SaveSignals.m'
-Place all ultrasonic raw data files in 'Raw UT Data' folder. Naming convention is not important.
-Open 'UT_SaveSignals.m' in Matlab
-Run script.
-Answer the details in the command window, including workspace variable name and data set information.


4. How to Save a New Ultrasonic Data Set - Non-Preferred Method
	This method uses 'UT_SaveSignals_Sequence.m'

-Place all ultrasonic raw data files in 'Raw UT Data' folder
	*note: do not place files in sub-folders within 'Raw UT Data'
	*note: together, all files must meet the following criteria:
		- Cut indices must include 1,2,3...N
		- Data series count must be the same for ALL cuts
-Use naming convention as in example below:
	for ML80 Steel, Specimen 1, Cut 3, data set 2, longitudinal data, name the file:
		'ML80_s1_c3_long_2.txt'
-Open 'UT_SaveSignals_Sequence.m' in Matlab
-Set desired file parameters in 'UT_SaveSignals.m', such as steel type used, number of cuts made, etc
	*note: if a new steel type is being used, there is a section later in 'UT_SaveSignals.m' where a new steel type can be added to the list


5. Purpose of UT_Signal file

'UT_Signal.m' is a definition file on how to save ultrasonic signals. Open it to see what information is saved about ultrasonic signals. 
If you want to make changes to this file, make sure you also change the 'UT_Signal.m' file in the folder 'Matlab UT Data'

As of second iteration of folder
August 8, 2018

Within this folder there are 3 subfolder:
-Functions
	- Contains 14 functions
-Matlab UT Data
	- Contains 5 data structures
-Raw UT Data
	- is empty

There are also 5 '.m' files:
-UT_Fourier.m
-UT_SaveSignals.m
-UT_SaveSignals_Sequence.m
-UT_Signal.m
-UT_VelocityAnalysis.m

The 14 functions are:
